## This is my MVP of a responsive mobile map showing the most recent data on worldwide Covid-19 cumulative deaths, by country. 
## For now I will have to manually update the data but the plan is to add an API so that it updates automatically. I will also create an interactive key so that users can toggle between different data topics. 

## the app was built using Expo, React Native, react-native-gesture-handler, and D3. 

### covid data from covid19.who.it
### special thanks to Jo Berkner of @GeoLic for sharing his passion for data visualization, and explaining this process in such painstaking detail. 

#### commit #b6b01b4 is the fully rendered map, pre-data and pre-gesture.
